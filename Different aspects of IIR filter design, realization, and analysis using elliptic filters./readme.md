% Filter Specifications
Wp = 0.45;  % Normalized passband edge frequency (0.45œÄ rad/sample)
Ws = 0.55;  % Normalized stopband edge frequency (0.55œÄ rad/sample)
Rp = 0.1;   % Passband ripple (0.1 dB)
Rs = 30;    % Stopband attenuation (30 dB)

% Filter Design
[N, Wn] = ellipord(Wp, Ws, Rp, Rs);  % Determine minimum order
[b, a] = ellip(N, Rp, Rs, Wn);       % Design elliptic filter

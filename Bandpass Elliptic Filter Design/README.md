# Bandpass Elliptic Filter Design

## Analysis of MATLAB Bandpass Elliptic Filter Code

### 1. Filter Specifications
- **Normalized frequency bands** (normalized to Nyquist frequency = 1):
  - Passband: 0.3 to 0.7
  - Stopbands: below 0.2 and above 0.8
- **Gain requirements**:
  - Passband ripple (G_p): 0.99 (min allowed passband gain)
  - Stopband attenuation (G_s): 0.01 (max allowed stopband gain)
- Converted to dB scale:

### 2. Filter Design
- `ellipord()` calculates the minimum filter order N and natural frequency W_n
- `ellip()` designs the elliptic filter with:
- Order N
- Passband ripple R_p
- Stopband attenuation R_s
- Bandpass type with cutoff frequencies W_n

### 3. Filter Implementation
- Transfer function ([a, b] coefficients) converted to Second-Order Sections (SOS) using `tf2sos()`
- SOS form is numerically more stable for higher-order filters
- Includes a gain factor g

### 4. Analysis and Visualization
- `fvtool()` shows the frequency response (magnitude)
- `grpdelay()` plots the group delay (phase linearity)
- Commented alternative approach uses pole-zero-gain design first

### 5. Coefficient Output
- Displays SOS coefficients (for implementation)
- Shows original numerator (a) and denominator (b) coefficients

## Key Characteristics of Elliptic Filters
1. **Equiripple behavior**: Ripples in both passband and stopband
2. **Sharp transition**: Fastest transition for given order
3. **Nonlinear phase**: As seen in group delay plot
4. **High selectivity**: Good for sharp cutoff requirements

## Potential Applications
- When strict frequency-domain specs are needed
- Where filter order must be minimized
- Applications tolerant of nonlinear phase response

## Note on Normalized Frequencies
- 1.0 = Nyquist frequency (Â½ sampling rate)
- Example: For 10 kHz sample rate:
- Passband = 1.5-3.5 kHz
